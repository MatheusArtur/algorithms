#+TITLE: Introduction to Algorithms (Book)
#+CREATOR: Matheus Costa (macc)
* Notes and references
  On it's core this file is a resume containing answers and notes of the book "Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd ed (2009), Thomas H. Cormen.." published by MIT. It also have stuff from my data structure class.
* DONE Algorithms Efficiency
   Algorithm efficiency is actually something, and to measure it you need to consider two things: First being a constant =c=, that will resolve around many variables from languague compiler/interpreter/assembler binary speed to the computer itself. The second one focus on the number of interactions, and it's represented by a mathematical expression based on the algorithm. Combine the two, and you have how many instructions you need to run certain algorithm. 
   The constant =c= often impacts little on the run, so it's pretty much useless. 

   A good example for measuring efficiency it's comparing the Linear Seach to the Binary Search.
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  int linear_search(int *v, int size, int item){
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<size;i++){
      if(v[i] == item){
        return i;
      }
    }
    return 0;
  }

  int binary_search(int *v, int bottom, int top, int item){
    int middle = floor((top + bottom) * pow(2, -1));
    if(v[middle] < item){
      binary_search(v, middle, top, item);
    }
    else if (v[middle] > item){
      binary_search(v, bottom, middle, item);
    }
    return middle;    
  }
#+END_SRC

   For a 0-100 array number, let's compare both when searching for 73.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Linear search found 73 with 73 interactions!

Binary search at 50
Binary search at 75
Binary search at 62
Binary search at 68
Binary search at 71
Binary search at 73

Binary search found 73 with 6 interactions!
#+END_EXAMPLE
   
   Binary found with 67 less intructions! That's because linear runs at (n) and binary at log(n): [[./img/search.png]]

   Sorting algorithms are also nice for comparing efficiency. Let's see how little the constant does when comparing a Merge sort =c1= versus Insertion sort =c2=, =c1= > =c2=.
   Merge runs at =n * log(n)=, insertion =2^n= and =n= = objects.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  double insertion(double n){
    return  8 * pow(2, n);
  }
  double merge(double n){
    return  64 * (n * log(n));
  }
#+END_SRC
   Output: 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  2 objects:
   Insert = 32
   Merge = 89

  3 objects:
   Insert = 64
   Merge = 211

  4 objects:
   Insert = 128
   Merge = 355

  5 objects:
   Insert = 256
   Merge = 515

  6 objects:
   Insert = 512
   Merge = 688

  7 objects:
   Insert = 1024
   Merge = 872

  At 7 objects, Merge has 872 instructions nedded to sort, 152 less than insert
#+END_EXAMPLE
   
   Even with a 8 times bigger =c=, merge outruns the insertion from few as 7 numbers.

** Insertion Sort

   Insertion takes a array index number as a key and compares to all previous positions possible until =key > array[previous]=.
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  void insertion(int *v, int size){
    int key_t, i, j;
    for(j=1;j<size;++j){
      key_t = v[j];
      i = j - 1;
      while(i>=0 && v[i] > key_t){
        v[i+1] = v[i];
        v[i] = key_t;
        --i;
      }
    }
  }
#+END_SRC
   Note that it starts with j = [FIRST+1] array position, since of course you'll be comparing to previous numbers.

** Merge sort

#+BEGIN_SRC c
void merge(int *v, int l_index, int r_index){
  if(l_index >= r_index){
    return ;
  }
  int l, r, key_t, aux;
  l = l_index;
  r = r_index;
  key_t = v[(l_index + r_index)/2];
  while(l <= r){
    while(v[l] < key_t) ++l;
    while(v[r] > key_t) --r;
    if(l <= r){
      aux = v[r];
      v[r] = v[l];
      v[l] = aux;
      ++l; --r;
    }
  }
  merge(v, l_index, r);
  merge(v, l, r_index);
}

void insertion(int *v, int size){
  int key_t, i, j;
  for(j=1;j<size;++j){
    key_t = v[j];
    i = j - 1;
    while(i>=0 && v[i] > key_t){
      v[i+1] = v[i];
      v[i] = key_t;
      --i;
    }
  }
}

** What are data structures?
A good data structure would be an array. But,

- Advantages of array:
Being so easy-to-use and intuitive.

- Disvantages of array
A shitfest to realloc and becomes pretty couter-intuitive for complex use.

- Acessing non-valid positions
In C, it gets a n from memory.
In other languages like java, it warns.

** Linked Lists

- Pointers are used to link each node of our list

fa -> fb -> nil

where fX is the guy, and arrow is the pointer.

- Versatility

The liked list is powerful. It can easily be resized, just point it to (eg; ff) instead of nil.

- Why?

It can be used to write specifically FREE-Memory instead of overwriting it.

- How?
Try this C code, look how it recursively the structure is called with a pointer. It has a structure with a item and a pointer to a new structure.
 #+BEGIN_SRC c
   typedef struct{
     int data;
     struct node* next;
   }node;
 #+END_SRC

** Applying create, add, search and many other functions in linked list.

*** Creating a node 
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  node *new_node = NULL;
#+END_SRC

*** Adding elements
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  void add(node **head, int item){
     node *new_node = (node*) malloc(sizeof(node));
     new_node->item = item;
     new_node->next = *head;
     *head = new_node;
   }
#+END_SRC

*** Search function
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  node* search(node **head, int item){
    while(*head != NULL){
      if((*head)->item == item){
        return *head;
      }
      *head = (*head)->next;
    }
      return NULL;    
  }
#+END_SRC

*** TODO Remove function
    This is a tricky one, you'll need to use a pointer to save the previous position and point it to the current->next
#+BEGIN_SRC c
//TODO
#+END_SRC

** Void, and fuction as a pointer
Well, instead of having for example, a integer and a pointer, you have a pointer to another list (structure) of passagers, students, whatever..
|----------+-----+----------+-----+----------+-----|
| 2        | ->  | 5        | ->  | 9        | ->  |
|----------+-----+----------+-----+----------+-----|
| *bellow* | ->  | *bellow* | ->  | *bellow* | ->  |
| passager | nil | passager | nil | passager | nil |
|----------+-----+----------+-----+----------+-----|

*** Void can point to almost everything!
This can be pretty useful to change and reutilize the code.
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  typedef struct{
    void* item;
    struct node* next;
  }node;
#+END_SRC

# But notice: In algorithims like the search one, you cannot check (*void == (void)item), so you'll be making a specific search function and pass it with an pointer.
So, lets create a universal search function.
#+BEGIN_SRC c
// TODO
node* search(node *head, void item){
  while(*head != NULL){
    if(*head->item == item){
      return *head;
    }
    head = head->next;
  }
    return NULL;    
}

- "LIFO" - Last In, First Out.
  LIFO consists in tree main operations:

  - =Push=, adds a element to the stack top
  - =Pop=, removes the stack top element
  - =Peek=, shows the stack top element


** Creating a Stack

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  #define MAX_STACK_SIZE 10

  struct stack{
    int current_size;
    int items(MAX_STACK_SIZE);
  };

  stack* create_stack(){
    stack *new_stack = (stack*) malloc(sizeof(stack));
    new_stack -> current_size = 0;
    return new_stack;
  }
#+END_SRC

** PUSH function

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  void push(stack *stack, int item){
    if(stack->current_size == MAX_STACK_SIZE){
      printf("Stack Overflow\n");
    }
    else{
      stack->items[stack->current_size++] = item; ++ -- 
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

*** Stack with lists and PUSH function

    Note how the =push= above and =push_list= have similar headers due to abstractions.
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  struct *node{
    int item;
    node *next;
  }

  struct stack{
    node *top
  }

  stack* create_stack(){
    stack *new_stack = (stack*) malloc(sizeof(stack));
    new_stack->top = NULL;
    return new_stack;
  }
    
  void push_list(stack *stack, int item){
    node *new_top = (node*) malloc(sizeof(node));
    new_top->item = item;
    new_top->next = stack->top;
    stack->top = new_top;
  }
#+END_SRC

** POP Function
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  int pop(stack *stack){
    if(is_empty(stack)){
      printf("Stack underflow\n");
      return -1;
    }
    else{
      return stack->items[--stack->current_size];

  }

  int peek(stack *stack){

      printf("Stack underflow\n");
      return -1;
    }
    else{
      return stack->items[stack->current_size - 1];
    }
  }
